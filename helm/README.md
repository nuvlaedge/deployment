# NuvlaEdge Engine installation in Kubernetes

**This installation method is still in trial and should not be used for production**

## Requirements

Make sure you have:

- a Kubernetes cluster
- Helm (v3.4.2 or higher) on any machine, with access to the Kubernetes cluster
  above (it is enough to `export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/target-k8s-admin.conf` on
  the same node where Helm is installed).
- Make sure you are using system admin credentials of the cluster on which you
  are making the deployment of NuvlaEdge software.

## Install the NuvlaEdge Engine

First, go through the usual NuvlaEdge creation process via Nuvla, to get
your `NUVLAEDGE_UUID`.

This installation places the NuvlaEdge Engine in a single node of the Kubernetes
cluster (preferably a master). So before doing the installation, make sure you
choose your TARGET_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME. You can do this by
running `kubectl get nodes` and choosing one of the master nodes.

Then, from this directory, run:

```
helm install --set NUVLAEDGE_UUID=<paste_NUVLAEDGE_UUID_from_nuvla> \
    --set kubernetesNode=<TARGET_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME> \
    $(echo "<paste_NUVLAEDGE_UUID_from_nuvla>" | tr "/" "-") .
```

This will install the core NuvlaEdge Engine components in your Kubernetes node,
within the namespace "nuvlaedge-<uuid_of_your_nuvlaedge>".

### Approve NuvlaEdge manager certificate

After running `helm install ...` command, the output will contain instructions
for running certificate signing request approval command
`kubectl certificate approve`. Example:

```shell
1. After the initial installation, to approve the certificate signing request
   for the certificate used to manage the NuvlaEdge instance please run the
   following command as system admin of the K8s cluster
   
   kubectl certificate approve nuvlaedge-csr
```

Please check the actual output of the command and follow the provided
instructions.

### Troubleshooting NuvlaEdge manager certificate signing request

If for whatever reason the NuvlaEdge manager certificate signing request failed,
it's possible to re-run the request.

Because the credential manager is implemented as Kubernetes Job, to actually
re-run the Job it needs to be replaced. Use example command below and adjust it
to your case:

```shell
kubectl -n nuvlabox-<uuid_of_your_nuvlaedge> get job kubernetes-credentials-manager -o json | \
   jq 'del(.spec.selector)' | jq 'del(.spec.template.metadata.labels)' | kubectl replace --force -f -
```

Example of running the command within the actual NuvlaEdge namespace:

```shell
$ kubectl -n nuvlabox-f1757497-efc4-4636-b921-e36711104521 get job kubernetes-credentials-manager -o json | \
   jq 'del(.spec.selector)' | jq 'del(.spec.template.metadata.labels)' | kubectl replace --force -f -
job.batch "kubernetes-credentials-manager" deleted
job.batch/kubernetes-credentials-manager replaced
$
```

### Enable optional NuvlaEdge Engine components

The following components are optional:
 - security
 - peripheral-manager-usb
 - peripheral-manager-network
 - peripheral-manager-bluetooth
 - peripheral-manager-gpu
 - peripheral-manager-modbus

To enable them at installation time, simply
add `--set security=true --set peripheralManagerGPU=true # etc.` to the command
above, according to your preferences.

### Parameterization

There are certain parameters that can be set at installation time.

#### Change the Docker Images of the components being installed

Add `--set images.<componentName>.repository=<your_image_repo> --set images.<componentName>.tag=<your_image_tag>`
to the command above, for every component's Docker image you want to override.
The <componentName> values can be found in "./values.yaml".

Example:

```
helm install --set NUVLAEDGE_UUID=<paste_NUVLAEDGE_UUID_from_nuvla> \
    --set kubernetesNode=<TARGET_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME> \
    --set images.agent.repository=nuvladev/agent \
    --set images.agent.tag=main \
    # etc...
```
