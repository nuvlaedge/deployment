This repository container the definitions for the installation of NuvlaEdge.

For further details, go to the [online documentation](https://docs.nuvla.io/nuvlaedge/).

## Artifacts

In this repository you will find three different compose files:
 - **docker-compose.yml**: this is meant for a production NuvlaEdge installation,
 where `nuvla.io` is the default Nuvla endpoint

 - **docker-compose.*.yml**: these are optional peripheral managers

## Releasing

To trigger an automatic release of NuvlaEdge, simply run:

```bash
./trigger-release.sh VERSION
```

where `VERSION` is the tag version to be released, with semantic versioning (e.g. 1.0.0).

## Deploying

### Prerequisites

To install NuvlaEdge, you'll need:
 - *Docker (version 18 or higher)*
 - *Docker Compose (version 1.23.2 or higher)*

NuvlaEdge will, during bootstrap, double check for other requirements (like
Docker Swarm), but you'll be automatically prompted in case some of these are not met.


### Production Deployment

_**artifact:** docker-compose.yml_

In this scenario, we assume you are using Nuvla at https://nuvla.io.

 1. login into https://nuvla.io or your Nuvla installation
 2. create a `nuvlaedge` resource and save the UUID
 3. simply `export NUVLAEDGE_UUID=` UUID you saved, **or** paste that UUID in the `docker-compose.yml` file, under the NUVLAEDGE_UUID environment variable
 4. If you are using your own Nuvla installation also `export NUVLA_ENDPOINT=` IP of the local Nuvla instance, **or** paste that IP in the `docker-compose.yml` file, under the NUVLA_ENDPOINT environment variable
 5. install NuvlaEdge
    ```bash
    $ docker compose -p nuvlaedge -f docker-compose.yml up
    ```
    NOTE: add `-f docker-compose.usb.yml -f ... `, to the command above, in order to add the auto peripheral discovery components
